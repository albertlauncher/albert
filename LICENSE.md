Informal note:

This is basically a BSD-2-Clause without the permission for redistribution of modifications and an explicit exclusion of Microsoft or Apple platforms.
I am not a lawyer and it is hard to properly regulate redistribution of modifications so I simply do not permit it. 
However, if you just want to help with e.g. a public pull request, I will turn a blind eye.
